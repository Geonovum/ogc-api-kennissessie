      summary: feature collections in the dataset 'Daraa'
      description: >-
        The dataset is organized in feature collections. This resource provides
        information about and access to the feature collections.

        The response contains the list of collections. For each collection, a
        link to the items in the collection (path
        `/collections/{collectionId}/items`, link relation `items`) as well as
        key information about the collection.

        This information includes:


        * A local identifier for the collection that is unique for the dataset;

        * A title and description for the collection;

        * An indication of the spatial and temporal extent of the data in the
        collection;

        * A list of coordinate reference systems (CRS) in which geometries may
        be returned by the server. The first CRS is the default coordinate
        reference system (the default is always WGS 84 with axis order
        longitude/latitude);

        * The CRS in which the spatial geometries are stored in the data source
        (if data is requested in this CRS, the geometries are returned without
        any coordinate conversion);

        * An indicator about the type of the items in the collection (the
        default value is 'feature').

      description: >-
        The response is a document consisting of features in the collection. The
        features included in the response are determined by the server based on
        the query parameters of the request.


        To support access to larger collections without overloading the client,
        the API supports paged access with links to the next page, if more
        features are selected that the page size (maximum page size is 10000).


        The `bbox` and `datetime` parameter can be used to select only a subset
        of the features in the collection (the features that are in the bounding
        box or time interval). The `bbox` parameter matches all features in the
        collection that are not associated with a location, too. The `datetime`
        parameter matches all features in the collection that are not associated
        with a time stamp or interval, too. The `limit` parameter may be used to
        control the subset of the selected features that should be returned in
        the response, the page size. Each page may include information about the
        number of selected and returned features (`numberMatched` and
        `numberReturned`) as well as links to support paging (link relation
        `next`).

      summary: retrieve features in the feature collection 'energielabels'
      description: >-
        The response is a document consisting of features in the collection. The
        features included in the response are determined by the server based on
        the query parameters of the request.


        To support access to larger collections without overloading the client,
        the API supports paged access with links to the next page, if more
        features are selected that the page size (maximum page size is 10000).


        The `bbox` and `datetime` parameter can be used to select only a subset
        of the features in the collection (the features that are in the bounding
        box or time interval). The `bbox` parameter matches all features in the
        collection that are not associated with a location, too. The `datetime`
        parameter matches all features in the collection that are not associated
        with a time stamp or interval, too. The `limit` parameter may be used to
        control the subset of the selected features that should be returned in
        the response, the page size. Each page may include information about the
        number of selected and returned features (`numberMatched` and
        `numberReturned`) as well as links to support paging (link relation
        `next`).

      summary: retrieve features in the feature collection 'kemersgewijze_verhuur'
      description: >-
        The response is a document consisting of features in the collection. The
        features included in the response are determined by the server based on
        the query parameters of the request.


        To support access to larger collections without overloading the client,
        the API supports paged access with links to the next page, if more
        features are selected that the page size (maximum page size is 10000).


        The `bbox` and `datetime` parameter can be used to select only a subset
        of the features in the collection (the features that are in the bounding
        box or time interval). The `bbox` parameter matches all features in the
        collection that are not associated with a location, too. The `datetime`
        parameter matches all features in the collection that are not associated
        with a time stamp or interval, too. The `limit` parameter may be used to
        control the subset of the selected features that should be returned in
        the response, the page size. Each page may include information about the
        number of selected and returned features (`numberMatched` and
        `numberReturned`) as well as links to support paging (link relation
        `next`).

      summary: retrieve features in the feature collection 'Inventarisatie_zonnepanelen'
      description: >-
        The response is a document consisting of features in the collection. The
        features included in the response are determined by the server based on
        the query parameters of the request.


        To support access to larger collections without overloading the client,
        the API supports paged access with links to the next page, if more
        features are selected that the page size (maximum page size is 10000).


        The `bbox` and `datetime` parameter can be used to select only a subset
        of the features in the collection (the features that are in the bounding
        box or time interval). The `bbox` parameter matches all features in the
        collection that are not associated with a location, too. The `datetime`
        parameter matches all features in the collection that are not associated
        with a time stamp or interval, too. The `limit` parameter may be used to
        control the subset of the selected features that should be returned in
        the response, the page size. Each page may include information about the
        number of selected and returned features (`numberMatched` and
        `numberReturned`) as well as links to support paging (link relation
        `next`).


        See the details of this operation for a description of additional query
        parameters supported by this resource.

        the sequence of minimum longitude, minimum latitude, maximum longitude
        and maximum latitude. However, in cases where the box spans the

        Filter features in the collection using the query expression in the
        parameter value. Filter expressions are written in the [Common Query
        Language (CQL2)](https://docs.ogc.org/is/21-065r1/21-065r1.html), which
        is an OGC Standard.


        The recommended language for this query parameter is CQL2 Text
        (`filter-lang=cql2-text`).


        CQL2 Text expressions are similar to SQL expressions and also support
        spatial, temporal and array predicates. All property references must be
        queryables of the collection and must be declared in the Queryables
        sub-resource of the collection.


        The following are examples of CQL Text expressions:


        * Logical operators (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`) are supported

        * Simple comparison predicates (`=`, `<>`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`):
          * `address.LocalityName = 'Bonn'`
          * `measuredHeight > 10`
          * `storeysAboveGround <= 4`
          * `creationDate > DATE('2017-12-31')`
          * `creationDate < DATE('2018-01-01')`
          * `creationDate >= DATE('2018-01-01') AND creationDate <= DATE('2018-12-31')`
        * Advanced comparison operators (`LIKE`, `BETWEEN`, `IN`, `IS NULL`):
          * `name LIKE '%Kirche%'`
          * `measuredHeight BETWEEN 10 AND 20`
          * `address.LocalityName IN ('Bonn', 'Köln', 'Düren')`
          * `address.LocalityName NOT IN ('Bonn', 'Köln', 'Düren')`
          * `name IS NULL`
          * `name IS NOT NULL`
        * Spatial operators (the standard Simple Feature operators, e.g.,
        `S_INTERSECTS`, `S_WITHIN`):
          * `S_INTERSECTS(bbox, POLYGON((8 52, 9 52, 9 53, 8 53, 8 52)))`
        * Temporal operators (e.g., `T_AFTER`, `T_BEFORE`, `T_INTERSECTS`)
          * `T_AFTER(creationDate, DATE('2018-01-01'))`
          * `T_BEFORE(creationDate, DATE('2018-01-01'))`
          * `T_INTERSECTS(creationDate, INTERVAL('2018-01-01','2018-12-31'))`
          * `T_INTERSECTS(INTERVAL(begin,end), INTERVAL('2018-01-01','2018-12-31'))`
